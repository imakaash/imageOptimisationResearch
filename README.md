## Non-local Regularization of Inverse Problems

This study as part of my research case study with University of Trier for wise 22/23 focuses on solving linear ill-posed inverse problems in image processing using non-local regularization techniques.

## Brief Introduction to Theory

Inverse problems, as opposed to direct problems, are typically ill-posed in the sense of Hadamard. According to Hadamard's work in 1902, well-posed problems satisfy three properties:

1.  Existence of a solution
2.  Uniqueness of solution
3.  Stability of solution

Problems that violate at least one of these properties are considered ill-posed. A classic example is Cauchy's problem for the Laplace equation.The stability requirement is particularly crucial, as noted by Courant and Hilbert (1962). Stability means the solution depends continuously on the data. Without stability, computing a practical solution becomes nearly impossible due to unavoidable errors in measurements or numerical computations. As Lanczos aptly stated:

> "Lack of information cannot be remedied by any mathematical trickery"

## Key Aspects of the Paper

The paper presents:

-   A new framework for regularizing linear inverse problems using total variation on non-local graphs
-   An adaptive non-local graph that matches the structures of the image to be recovered
-   A fast algorithm that iteratively computes both the regularized solution and the adapted non-local graph

## Simulating Noise

To test the robustness of the proposed method, Gaussian white noise is added to the input signals. The noise simulation can be implemented as follows:

python

    import numpy as np def  
    add_gaussian_noise(signal, std_dev): 
	    """ 
	    Add Gaussian white noise to a signal. 
	    Parameters: 
	    signal (ndarray): Input signal 
	    std_dev (float): Standard deviation of the noise 
	    Returns: 
	    ndarray: Signal with added noise 
	    """ 
	    noise = np.random.normal(0, std_dev, signal.shape) 
	    return signal + noise

This function takes a signal `u` as input and returns an ndarray representing the image with added Gaussian noise of the specified standard deviation.

## Results and Conclusions

The non-local regularization approach presented in this paper shows significant improvements over traditional methods, particularly for:

-   Inpainting random pixels
-   Compressive sensing recovery
-   Image super-resolution

The adaptive nature of the non-local graph allows for better reconstruction of geometric edges and textures present in natural images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods for certain classes of inverse problems.
